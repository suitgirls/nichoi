    <h3>The life of Mary Louise Prather</h3>
    <p>Nicole Choi   |   July 24th, 2024</p>
    <p>
        More times than not, women are underestimated for their talents and not appreciated for their accomplishments. Many women succeeded in high math 
        and coding jobs, including Mary Louise Prather. Joining as a civilian stenographer in the Signal Intelligence Service, she worked in the office
        and alongside machines to transcribe messages. Prather was a true demonstration of intellect and made sure her hard work was noticed.

    <h2>Growing up/achievement</h2>
    <p>
        Prather trained and received schooling from many places to take on her profession as a stenographer. Just a few topics she had to master were 
        cryptographic security, code compilation, elementary and advanced cryptography, and many more. She also trained in Japanese and German,
        which later caused her to identify an association between Japanese messages. After noticing this connection in the two messages, then came the 
        creation of a decryption key for the Japanese code. Japanese coded messages then started to decrypt during the war in the 1940s and aided the US.
