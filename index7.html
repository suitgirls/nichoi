 <h1> Nicole's Biography </h1>

<p>
    Hi this is Nicole! I am a senior and from southern california. 
</p>
<p>
    I decided to take on the IT-girls program because I have never been exposed to data systems and coding. In technology,
    I have interests in hopefully coding for games and making mods as well as tracking data of my studies and life.
</p>


<h2>Personal Information</h2>
<p>
    Outside of school I love cooking with my mom, going out spontaneously with friends, and getting matcha
    (my fave drink yum). I want to go to as many restaurants and cafes as I can during my life time.
    I am adventurous and very independent but love meeting new friends! I tend to be bubbly and ask lots of questions to
    get to know the other person. 
</p>
<p>
    Reach out if you ever want to go on a matcha or boba run!
